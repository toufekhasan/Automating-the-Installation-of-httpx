🚀 Automating the Installation of httpx | Author: Toufek Hasan
httpx is a powerful tool by ProjectDiscovery for probing web servers. To make the installation process seamless on Kali Linux, I created a Bash script that automates everything from updating the system to configuring httpx for system-wide use.

🔧 What This Script Does:
✅ Updates Kali Linux
✅ Installs Golang
✅ Sets up Go environment variables
✅ Clones and installs httpx
✅ Moves the httpx binary to /usr/local/bin for easy access

🚀 Installation & Usage:
1️⃣ Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/httpx-installer.git

2️⃣ Give execution permission and run:

chmod +x install_httpx.sh
./install_httpx.sh

3️⃣ Verify installation:

httpx -version

🔗 Why Use This Script?
Manually installing tools can be time-consuming. This script ensures a smooth, error-free setup so you can focus on penetration testing and security research instead of troubleshooting dependencies.
